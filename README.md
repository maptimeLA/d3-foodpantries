# Turning food bank data into a D3 map
We'll take a look at the [food bank data](https://github.com/maptimeLA/food_bank_data_bank) and see what can be mapped using [D3](http://d3js.org/).

Our main goal will be to calculate and show the total number of food pantries in a given L.A. neighborhood.

You'll need some knowledge of the following:

- QGIS
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Step 1 - Join two GIS files
Let's start by grabbing the the [FoodPantriesMaster file](https://github.com/maptimeLA/food_bank_data_bank/blob/master/datasets/FoodSources/FoodPantries/FoodPantriesMaster.geojson) in the food bank data repo.

In QGIS, each dot represents a food pantry location. The pantry's location includes agency information and an address. But since it's a GIS file it already has the latitude and longitude for each location. We can use this to do a count of the number of pantries in a particular L.A. neighborhood.

We'll need a shapefile with polygons of neighborhoods to do this. Luckily, these shapes are available for free at the Los Angeles Times' [boundaries site](http://boundaries.latimes.com/sets/). 

I've already removed neighborhoods from Los Angeles County and saved both files with NAD83 projection (EPSG:4269). They can be found in step1/start.

Open both shape files in QGIS and select Vector > Analysis Tools > Points in Polygon

QGIS should figure out which file has polygons and which has points. We'll need to set an output name and find a place to save it. 

![Step1](http://www.jschleuss.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/step1.png)

Hit 'OK' and now you've got a file that has the total number of pantries in each neighborhood polygon.

## Step 2 - Simplify the shapefile
If we were to output this file as a geojson for the Web map we'd get a 1.3 megabyte file. That's a bit large. 

So, take the file into [mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org/) and simplify it. You'll need to use Chrome. Compress your shapefiles (or save it as GeoJSON using QGIS). Then upload it to mapshaper. 

Select "Simplify" in the top-right corner. Then make sure "prevent shape removal" is checked. And "Visvalingam/weighted area" should be fine for this project. Now, drag the slider at the top.

I'd go to about 19% and "repair intersections." Then export as GeoJSON.

## Step 3 - Get a basic map in D3
Now let's get it into D3.

You'll need to be running a server locally using Python.

2. `cd d3-foodpantries`
3. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
4. Go to your browser and open `http://localhost:8000/`
5. To open on your phone, find your IP address and open `http://[YOUR-IP-ADDRESS]:8000/`

If you take a look in the "step3" folder you'll see the code for a basic map. 

## Step 4 - Add colors based on data in GeoJSON file
We can use D3 to color the map based on the data in the file.

Peak in the "step4" folder and you'll see a function that relies on the data to get a color. You need to have done some work to figure out where you want your breaks and how many before you make it here. 

## Step 5 - Add interactivity with tooltip
Here's some code to get us a tooltip.

Inside the "step5" folder is a file that uses D3's mouse events to show and hide a tooltip div, while populating it with data from the GeoJSON file.

## Step 6 - Push your own map to github.
Duplicate the "index.html" file in the "step6" folder. Give it your name or something like ```jschleuss.html``` without spaces.

Then create your own visualization. The GeoJSON file in this folder has more columns of data. Maybe use [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org) to find some better colors.
